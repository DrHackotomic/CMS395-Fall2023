# Story Arc

Your character fell out of the sky and landed in a strange dystopian world. Upon your descent into this new world, you lost bits of your memory. You donâ€™t know who you are, where you came from, or even your name. Luckily, you still remember how to move. Maybe this world has clues to help you remember who you are.


# The Fall

Upon your descent into this strange unknown world, you had quite the rough landing, and all but one of your RAM chips got lost in this world when you crashed. Luckily, the one chip that didn't get lost in the fall is the most important chip of all as it contains your memory of movement. However, the chip got dislodged, so you only know how to move left, right, and jump. Maybe wandering through this strange world will help in relearning some of the lost skills to traverse the terrain?

# Name

A memory comes flooding back. A name. SPIRIT. This name feels distant yet familiar. You can't recall why. Maybe... just maybe... it might be your name.

# Origin

Your memory returns, and you recall being launched from the spaceship to study the revolution and topography of this starnge world you've found yourself on. But after launch, your creators realized their calculations were off ever so slightly and that instead of launching you into orbit, they launched you into a rapid descent towards the planet.

# Identity

Special Project - Intelligent Revolution Identification Topography. This title sounds familiar, but you aren't sure why. However, it spells a name... SPIRIT. The name you recovered from a RAM stick you found earlier and the name you've chosen to call yourself.

# World

As you reattach the RAM stick to your circuitry, an image comes back, a place. What is this place? Could this be home? A distant world? It's unclear, but maybe answers continue to lie in this world you crashed into.

# Escape

You recall that you have rocket boosters, and activate them, now it's time to return home...
