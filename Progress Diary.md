# Progress Diary
## Start Date: October 24th, 2023

### October 24th
Created diary as per Professor recommendation.

Romina: 
  - Created Google slides for Progress Update #2 presentation
  - Level templates set up in Unity
  - Pushed all current work to GitHub repository 
So far I have the basic scripts for the health system, the movement + jumping of the character, and doors that go to each level. I also created the levels, and one at the beginning for the title screen.
