  - Pushed all current work to GitHub repository
    
So far I have the basic scripts for the health system, the movement + jumping of the character, and doors that go to each level. I also created the levels, and one at the beginning for the title screen. I did have an incident where my original file was entirely corrupted, but I managed to save everything by creating a duplicate file.
