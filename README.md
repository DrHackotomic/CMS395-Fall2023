## Our game
### Lost in Limbo
Your character fell out of the sky and landed in a strange dystopian world. Upon your descent into this new world, you lost bits of your memory. You donâ€™t know who you are, where you came from, or even your name. Luckily, you still remember how to move. Maybe this world has clues to help you remember who you are.

We chose this idea as platformers are often a lot of fun and can be as simple or complex as the designer wants the levels to be. This allows us to get base mechanics down and working while having room to add more advanced mechanics later on if we want.

The inspiration comes from games that fall into the puzzle, platformer, adventure genre such as: LostWinds, Rain World, Hollow Knight to name a few.

### Game World
Our game world is very simple. Basic, soft colors for backgrounds and textures, and items that can be interacted with have brighter colors so that the player can figure out that they need to interact with these objects to proceed.
